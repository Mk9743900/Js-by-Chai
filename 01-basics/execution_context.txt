JavaScript execution conteXt// JEC

Global EC is "this."
Funtion EC 
Eval EC ==its a property of GEC

//
1st, memory creation phase 
2nd, execution phase

//
//Global EC (this)
let val1 = 1   //memory phase (val1=undefined,val2 = undefined)
let val2 = 5

funtion addNum(num1 ,num2){     //addNum = funtion created
    let total = num1 + num2     
    return total
}
let result1 = addNum(val1,val2) //result1 =undefined then it calls addnum funtion
let result2 = addNum(10,20)     //result2 = undefined

execution phase 
for result1
num1 = 10
num2 = 5
total = 15
then it return to Global EC 
then it goes to result1
after that it all gets deleted

for result2

memory phase 
then it all gets repeated  for result2 also
